如果是清理规则、优化规则、多语言改善的提议，建议直接发布 Pull Request 直接为 Dism++ 添加，不明白的可以直接通过邮箱或者 QQ 群直接联系我们；当然你发 Issue 也 没问题，只是开发者们没法处理，需要等待有志者帮你发 Pull Request 了。

如果是除此之外的问题，发 Issues 即可。

发 Issue 需要注意你当前使用的环境信息描述清楚，譬如 Dism++ 的版本、放置路径和截 图，Windows 的版本（完整版本，例如 10.0.18362.10014）、SKU（例如 专业版）、架构 （例如 AMD64），当然如果能提供 Dism++ 目录下 Config 内的日志文件（文件名: Dism++.log）和 Windows\Logs 目录内有关 CBS 和 DISM 的相关日志我们会更加高兴。

If it's a proposal to clean up rules, optimize rules, and improve multiple languages, it's recommended to issue a pull request directly to add to Dism++. If you don't understand, you can directly contact us through email or QQ group. Of course, you can send issue, but developers can't handle it. You need to wait for someone to send you a pull request.

If it is a problem other than this, just send issues.

When issuing issue, you need to pay attention to the clear description of the environment information you are currently using, such as the version of Dism++, the placement path and screenshot, the version of windows (full version, such as 10.0.18362.10014), SKU (such as professional version), architecture (such as AMD64). Of course, if you can provide the log files in "Config" under the "Dism++" directory (file name: Dism++.log) and the "CBS" and "Dism" in the "Windows\Logs" directory, we will be more happy.
